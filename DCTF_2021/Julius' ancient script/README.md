# Julius' ancient script

In this challenge you are given a ciphertext in `flag.txt`, and need to recover its plaintext.
By the name of the challenge it's pretty obvious that this is a caesar cipher, but with a twist. The flag has numbers in it.

After a few minutes of trying every ROT*n* cipher on [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), I decided to Google search "Caesar cipher numbers", and one of the first results was [this](https://planetcalc.com/8572/). Putting the flag in here and searching for `dctf{` returned the plaintext flag.
