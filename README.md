# CTF-Writeups
This repository contains the writeups and walkthrough of Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions that I have participated in. The problems are mainly solved on Linux (Kali Linux, Parrot OS, Garuda OS) and few on Windows 10 machines.

The main languages used are ***bash*** and ***Python 2/3*** with a touch of ***C,C++,Sage,GO,SQL*** and many more.
