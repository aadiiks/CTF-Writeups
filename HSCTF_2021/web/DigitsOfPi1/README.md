Formula seems to be pointing to another sheet's called Source and its range 'A:B'. 

When you use spreadsheets, the accessibility tools actually help in un hiding hidden sheets, like the Source sheet here. 

To activate accessibility tools, go to Tools ('Outils' on the picture), and select Accessibility tools.

**Note: it turns out you can reach a hidden sheet's full range by just typing its name ('Source' instead of 'Source'!A:B)**

It reveals the hidden sheet! On the bottom left you can see it got added to the panes.
